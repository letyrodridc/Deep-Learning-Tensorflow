# Learning repository

This repository contains code written in Tensorflow for learning purposes.
Some code is from different courses like DeepLearning.AI Tensorflow Certification, and other for my authorship.
Each code has the credits to the authors.

### Notebooks included

#### 6_Binary_classification_with_ImageDataGenerator_Human_vs_Hourses
This notebook shows how to download a dataset and create an ImageDataGenerator for reading the images and labels. It's doing a binary classification in Keras-Tensorflow. 
The optimizer used is RMSProp.

#### 7-MNIST Classification
A super simple notebook doing MNIST classification.
